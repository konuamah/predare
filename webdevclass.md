**AI-Assisted Coding Introduction:**
Throughout this course, AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Cursor will transform how you learn and code. These assistants can generate boilerplate, explain complex concepts, debug errors, and even automate multi-step tasks—allowing you to focus on understanding core ideas rather than repetitive syntax. We'll start with simple prompts for code snippets and explanations, building up to agentic workflows for full features. The key is learning to verify AI output, iterate on suggestions, and use AI as a collaborative partner in your development process.

**Focus:** Understanding fundamentals - no projects yet. JavaScript will be practiced extensively in Next.js.
